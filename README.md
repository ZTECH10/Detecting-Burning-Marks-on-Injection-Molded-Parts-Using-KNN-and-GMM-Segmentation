# Detecting-Burning-Marks-on-Injection-Molded-Parts-Using-KNN-and-GMM-Segmentation


✨Project Description:
This project aims to automatically detect burning marks on parts manufactured by injection molding through image segmentation using KNN and GMM methods. The process involves capturing an image of the product and segmenting it to distinguish defects from normal product areas.




✨But what is Image Segmentation?

Image segmentation partitions an image into multiple segments, grouping pixels of the same object type together.





✨Common Use Cases:
1. Self-Driving Cars:
    * Segmenting pedestrians from the background.
2. Satellite Image Analysis:
    * Measuring total forest area.
3. Forest Fire Detection:
    * Using KMeans or GMM to segment and identify suspected flame areas.
    * Forest flame model detects fire regions in images.






✨Today's use case:

Industrial Application:
Image segmentation is crucial in defect detection for quality control in manufacturing. Automated systems analyze product images to identify flaws, cracks, or burns, ensuring high-quality production. This project focuses on using image segmentation to detect burning marks on injection molded parts
